I was lazy to make a new project from scratch, however since this laziness hindered me and the Udacity instructors have felt that my project is "plagiarized", not only that I raise a ticket and they don't respond for nearly a month, I will just make a new project from scratch to pass this project.

note to Udacity: "There is a lot that you need to work on, most importantly is your ticket responses"
